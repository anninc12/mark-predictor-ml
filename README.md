# Student Marks Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts a student's marks based on the number of hours they study.  
This project uses **Linear Regression**, one of the most popular supervised learning algorithms.

## Features
- Predicts marks based on study hours  
- Uses **Linear Regression** (Scikit-Learn)  
- Reads dataset from a CSV file  
- Train–test split for model evaluation  
- User input prediction  
- Beginner-friendly AI/ML project  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Linear Regression Algorithm

## Dataset (marks.csv)
```
Hours,Marks
1,20
2,35
3,50
4,60
5,75
6,85
```

## Project Structure
```
|-- marks_prediction.py
|-- marks.csv
|-- README.md
```

## How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
```
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

2. Run the Python file:
```
python marks_prediction.py
```

3. Enter study hours:
Example:
```
Enter study hours: 5
Predicted Marks: 64.20
```

## Sample Output
```
Actual Marks:
6    85
2    50

Predicted Marks:
[84.3 44.1]

Enter study hours: 5
Predicted Marks for 5 hours = 64.20
```

## Concepts Learned
